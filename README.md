# STMQRCode
QR code generator for STM32F407

# Overview
**STMQRCode** is the project of QR code generator. It generates QR codes based on text stored in SD card and displays it on Nokia5110 display.

# Description
The main step is to generate QR code based on text stored in .txt file on SD card. Limitation of length input text is related to resolution of Nokia5110 display and QR code size. User can store on card many files. A file extension filter was used to read the .txt file names and store them in a bidirectional, cyclic list. This list is used to navigate through the files. User can switch files by 2 buttons mounted on the breadboard (previous and next file). Using middle button user may generate QR code based on text stored in chosen .txt file.

# Progress
- [x] QR code generation based on .txt files stored in SD card,
- [x] implementation of bidirectional, cyclic list used to navigate through files,
- [x] support for user interface buttons,
- [x] display file names on Nokia5110 display,
- [ ] wrtite QR code to bitmap on SD card,
- [ ] display existing QR codes from bitmaps stred on SD card,
- [ ] folder support.

# Tools
CooCox CoIDE, Version: 1.7.8

# How to run
To run the project you should have hardware:
* STM32f4-DISCOVERY board,
* SD Card Module and SD Card formatted to FAT32,
* Nokia 3310/5110 LCD screen,
* 3 switches.

How to use?
1. Connect STM32F4-DISCOVERY board with SD Card Module in this way:
```
    STM32 <---> SD Card Module
    GND <---> GND
    3V <---> 3V3
    PB11 <---> CS
    PB15 <---> MOSI
    PB13 <---> SCK
    PB14 <---> MISO
    GND <---> GND
```
2. Connect 3 switches (PA5, PA7, PA8).
3. Connect Nokia 3310/5110 LCD screen in this way:
```
    STM32 <---> SD Card Module
    GND <---> GND
    GND <---> BL
    3V <---> VCC
    PB10 <---> CLK
    PC3 <---> DIN
    PC14 <---> DC
    PC13 <---> CE
    PC15 <---> RST

```
4. Build this project with CooCox CoIDE and Download Code to Flash.

# How to compile
